<p>You probably needed to split a full name into first and last name at some point.</p>

<p>How would you split the string <code>Ayrton Senna da Silva</code> into <code>Ayrton</code> as the first name and <code>Senna da Silva</code> as the last name?</p>

<p>What if the name contains inconsistent amounts of whitespace in between the words? Eg: <code style="white-space: pre;">Ayrton Senna da  Silva</code>.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
"Ayrton Senna da  Silva".split(" ")
# => ["Ayrton", "Senna", "da", "Silva"]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Splitting by space is a good start, but it doesn't finish the job.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I learned recently we can pass a second argument to <code>split</code> specifying the maximum number of splits:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
"Ayrton Senna da  Silva".split(" ", 2)
# => ["Ayrton", "Senna da  Silva"]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That almost worked, but we still have an extra space in the last name.</p>

<p>By combining it with <code>squish</code> we can get the desired result in a clean way:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
"Ayrton Senna da  Silva".squish.split(" ", 2)
# => ["Ayrton", "Senna da Silva"]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That's it.</p>
