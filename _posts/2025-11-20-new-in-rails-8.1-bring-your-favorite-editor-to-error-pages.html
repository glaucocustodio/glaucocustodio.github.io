<p>Rails 8.1.0 (released on October 22, 2025) brings a new feature that allows you to open the file that caused the error in your favorite editor.</p>

<p>To enable this feature, you need to set either <code>EDITOR</code> or <code>RAILS_EDITOR</code> environment variable with the path to your editor, for example:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# .bashrc / .zshrc
export RAILS_EDITOR="cursor"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then, when you are taken to the error page, click on the pencil icon to open it in your editor:</p>

<p>A new <code>ActiveSupport::Editor</code> class has been added to handle the editor functionality, check the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/55295" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">pull request</a> for more details.</p>
